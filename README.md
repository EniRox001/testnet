# testnet

Testnet is simply a dummy React application bootstrapped with TypeScript and Vite. It was mainly created in order for me to learn about passing data from child components to parent components in React. It was a pretty succesful project as it has allowed me to be able to effectively pass data from different pass of the application with states.
